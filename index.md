# About me

I'm currently playing the role of a Software Developer at AWS (Amazon Web Services, for the uninitiated)
In the past I have played the many roles that are a part of being a graduate student of Computer Science and Engineering at the State Universty of New York at Buffalo. 

I occasionally tinker with the guitar, and take long walks into the wilderness (Pandemics and wildfires allowing) 

I am currently engaged in the fast.ai course for deep learning which is turning out equal parts entertaining and educational

# Software Experience

I've dabbled a fair bit in the networking side of things. The more i dabble, the less i find I know.
I've worked at Infosys for ~3 and at Amazon for half a year now.
